            The Service Mesh provides the option to boost application security with mTLS enabled traffic between in mesh application components and external (to the mesh) services. In the context of Service Mesh eggress edge traffic there are several configuration options for this security feature and in this article we have clearly listed below the options (including options for clear text traffic) along with a linked example to get hands-on expertise with each scenario.

      <title>Red Hat Openshift Service Mesh - Federation Automated Setup</title>

            Service Mesh Federation Sometimes requirements (high-availability, multi-region based solutions) dictate the split of the solution deployments over multiple clusters. This brings the question How should we discover and call remotely deployed services from within Openshift Container Platform deployed workloads without explicit configuration of the remote deployment location?.
Red Hat Openshift Service Mesh (OSSM) based on Istio offers Federation of services to allow to export/import remote service as local. Therefore, so long as both caller and remote service are part of a Service Mesh offered by Red Hat Openshift Service Mesh the services can be called as if they were another local service as far as the caller is concerned.

            Introduction One of the benefits of a service mesh is security by design, in fact it is one of the main use cases which drives adoption of the mesh in cloud based environments where there are disparate types of microservice workloads.
Although this is very powerful as one can imagine there may be cases that a workload cannot participate in mTLS handshakes using the default mesh certificates. This is due to a workload having to handle its own TLS termination or because simply it should not receive TLS traffic (performance or policy reasons).

            Introduction I have recently supported a customer to deploy numerous applications over multiple OpenShift clusters running on top of hundreds of worker nodes, using external storage infrastructure for persistence and Red Hat Service Mesh (OSSM) for encryption, authentication and traffic management.
The method to deliver in this environment did not differ too much from delivering the applications in any other environment, with automation involved throughout, however when an application issue was reported for many of the platform maintenance team members it was not possible to hone in quickly on the area they should focus on.
