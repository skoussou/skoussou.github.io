            Overview For sometime now we have been, together with DevOps empowered application teams and DevOps engineers, using the OpenShift Pipelines, OpenShift&#39;s productised version of tekton.dev, as the Continuous Integration (CI) technology of choice when onboarding new applications or migrating existing ones into Red Hat&#39;s kubernetes.
Recently, the article on Migration from ClusterTasks to Tekton Resolvers in OpenShift Pipelines by colleagues Vincent Demeester and Koustav Saha and the GA of Pipelines as code prompted me to perform a refresher on the resources used as a baseline when starting a completely new implementation/migration or introducing the topic of tekton to a team.

            Introduction Recently, we were tasked with the migration of a set of AWS Java Lambda applications to containers on Red Hat&#39;s Kubernetes Platform of OpenShift on the Azure cloud. AWS Lambdas are compute services that let you run code without provisioning or managing servers and they can do so on-demand, on the other hand containers offer richer functionality with the ability to run long-running, on-demand, in-memory multithreaded services whilst they demand your attention to the configuration of the underlying container framework.
