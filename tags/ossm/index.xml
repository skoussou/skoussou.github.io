            Service Mesh Federation Sometimes requirements (high-availability, multi-region based solutions) dictate the split of the solution deployments over multiple clusters. This brings the question How should we discover and call remotely deployed services from within Openshift Container Platform deployed workloads without explicit configuration of the remote deployment location?.
Red Hat Openshift Service Mesh (OSSM) based on Istio offers Federation of services to allow to export/import remote service as local. Therefore, so long as both caller and remote service are part of a Service Mesh offered by Red Hat Openshift Service Mesh the services can be called as if they were another local service as far as the caller is concerned.

            Introduction One of the benefits of a service mesh is security by design, in fact it is one of the main use cases which drives adoption of the mesh in cloud based environments where there are disparate types of microservice workloads.
Although this is very powerful as one can imagine there may be cases that a workload cannot participate in mTLS handshakes using the default mesh certificates. This is due to a workload having to handle its own TLS termination or because simply it should not receive TLS traffic (performance or policy reasons).
